# 2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science - Depricated
A 2nd semester follow-up to the TEALS Intro CS course

This repository will be depricated after the 2016-17 school year.  The 2nd Semeseter Introduction to Computer Science curriculum is moving to a new GitHub repository and GitBook location starting the 2017-18 school year.

# About this curriculum
Welcome to the TEALS Intro to Computer Science Part 2 Curriculum.
This curriculum is intended for use by TEALS classrooms teaching Introduction to Computer Science in a yearlong format. We expect that students have completed the content from the [1st semester course](https://www.gitbook.com/book/teals-introcs/introduction-to-computer-science-principles/details) prior to this curriculum.

Please help us complete it by contributing feedback and suggestions via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles) that contains the source files for this gitbook: https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles

# Python Versions (2 vs 3)
Python is an evolving language. Python 3 is major upgrade to the language, released in 2010. There is a lot of existing software written under Python 2 and there is resistance to upgrading to Python 3 due to code breakage and cost. Just as a car part from a 10 year old model car will probably not fit a new model of the same car, Python 2 code probably would not run in a Python 3 environment. In Python 3 there are new features, significant upgrades "underneath" which makes the code run better and/or faster as well as no longer supporting (deprecating) some Python 2 capabilities. When looking at Python code, be careful to note whether it is Python2 or Pynton3.

**This class will use Python 3.**

For those knowledgable with Python 2, the following is a list of differences from Python 3 relevant to the 2nd semester intro course.

| | Python 2 | Python 3 |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| Printing to console | print 3.14 | print (3.14) |
| User input | raw_input()/input() | input () |
| Integer arithmetic | 3/2 evaluates to 1 | 3/2 evaluates to 1.5 |
| Not equal to | <> | != |

# Issues

Please open an issue in GitHub if you encounter factual, spelling, or grammatical errors, sequencing problems (topics needed before they are taught), or incomplete/missing materials.


# Suggestions
If you'd like to suggest changes or additions to the curriculum, please submit a Github Pull Request containing your changes. As a best practice, each pull request should contain a singular atomic change.
